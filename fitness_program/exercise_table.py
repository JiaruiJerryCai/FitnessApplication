        "description": "Pushups are calisthenic exercises that primarily targets the muscles of the chest, shoulders, and triceps. The exercise involves the individual lying prone on the ground, placing their hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, and then pushing their body up and down using the arms. The core muscles also play a role in stabilizing the body during the movement. Push-ups are a versatile and effective bodyweight exercise that can be adapted to different fitness levels and variations to target various muscle groups. They are commonly included in fitness routines to improve upper body strength and endurance."

        "description": "\t Pullups are strength training exercises that target the muscles of the upper body, particularly the back, shoulders, and arms. The exercise involves suspending oneself from a horizontal bar using an overhand grip (palms facing away from the body) with hands placed slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. The individual then pulls their body upward by bending their arms at the elbows until the chin reaches or clears the bar. Pull-ups primarily engage the latissimus dorsi (lats) muscles, as well as the biceps, rhomboids, and various muscles in the upper back. \n \t Pull-ups are considered a challenging bodyweight exercise, requiring upper body strength and control. They can be performed with different grip variations, such as wide grip, narrow grip, or underhand (chin-up), to target various muscle groups. Pull-ups are commonly incorporated into strength training and calisthenics routines to enhance overall upper body strength and muscular development."

        "description": 'Jumping jacks are a dynamic and invigorating full-body exercise that combines cardiovascular benefits with muscle engagement. This simple yet effective calisthenic movement involves starting from a standing position, then simultaneously jumping while spreading the legs wide and raising the arms overhead. The motion is then reversed by bringing the arms back down and returning the feet to the starting position. Jumping jacks engage multiple muscle groups, including the legs, core, arms, and shoulders, making them an excellent choice for a quick and efficient workout. Beyond their physical benefits, jumping jacks also serve as an excellent warm-up exercise, promoting increased heart rate, improved circulation, and enhanced flexibility. Whether incorporated into a fitness routine or used as a standalone exercise, jumping jacks offer a fun and accessible way to boost cardiovascular health and promote overall fitness.',
